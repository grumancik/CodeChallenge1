Increment 1 - 

We prompted the user for a noun and were able to store it in a variable and interpolate it into a string and print it back to the user.

Increment 2 - 

We prompted the user for multiple parts of speech and stored them in a hash, and were able to interpolate into a string and display the sentence back to the user.

Increment 3 - 

We created an array with three template sentences and looped through the array to display each template to the user with the interpolated parts of speech. We also used pry to look at each template before it was displayed.
